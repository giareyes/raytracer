c++ implementation of a ray tracer, currently following https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

potential follow ons after completing tutorial:
add lights
add more complex objects
add surface textures
add solid textures
parallelize code 
use more accurate equation for glass reflection as opposed to Schlick's approximation?
